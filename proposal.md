# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Crypto Price Alert Dicsord Bot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project is a dicord bot that allows a user to set price alerts for cryptos. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The user will be able to ask the bot for current prices of various top market cap crypto currencies by typing a special character assigned to prompt the bot to respond followed by the name of the crypto currency. The user will be able to set price alerts in the same manner. I will be using an API to get the data for the real time prices and it seems as though Coingecko is the best for that. The bot will feature customizable alert sounds aswell. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

My bot should be able to give current prices of crypto and set alerts for price targets of crypto.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I will have time to play around with how many different sounds I can have for alerts 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I want to add a function that has the bot follow a formula based on the RSI indicator of a crypto for buy and sell recommendation but im not sure I will be able to do something like this by the deadline

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First im going to create a discord bot and add it to a server which is something I have never done before and excited for since I have been using discord for so long. Then I'll need to initiate a discord client to run the bot and from there I'll start writing my code. This will be the first time im working with an API but i have worked with databases before like the irma lab. I will also need to research how to suggest a trade action based on an RSI chart of the cryptos price if I have time.
